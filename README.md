# Scratch LLM

This repo has everything I worked through while teaching myself how to build an LLM from scratch using the book, **Build a Large Language Model** by Sebastian Raschka. Most contents will follow from the text and code samples in the book, but I use this repo as a place for extra learnings related to building LLMs, such as linear algebra, PyTorch basics, and basic neural networks.

## Setup

To make sure the Jupyter Notebooks in this repo, run:

```zsh
source setup.sh
```

which will activate a Python virtual environment and instal ipykernel and the PyTorch library.

If you do not have a virtual environment, run

```zsh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

in your terminal **before** `setup.sh` to make sure you have a virtual environment directory in your environment.
